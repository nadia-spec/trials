    <h2 style="font-family: cursive;"align="center">What is Dhul Hijjah?</h2>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">Dhul Hijjah is the twelfth month of the Islamic Calendar. Muslims believe the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah to be the most virtuous days of the year in which Allah has blessed His <i>Ummah</i> with opportunities to multiply their rewards by <br> His mercies.</p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">Thus, muslims are encouraged to do more good deeds or increase their <i>Ibaadah</i> (i.e worship). Acts of worship that are encouraged include:</p>
    <ul style="font-family: cursive;">
        <li>Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah through praises, glorification etc.)</li>
        <li>Fasting (for the first nine days)</li>
        <li>Reciting the Quran</li>
        <li>Giving Sadaqah (Charity)</li>
    </ul>
